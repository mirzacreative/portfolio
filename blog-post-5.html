        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="text-xl text-slate-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Small businesses are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals who see them as easy marks with valuable data but limited security resources. A single breach can devastate your reputation, finances, and operations. The good news? Most cyberattacks can be prevented with fundamental security practices. This guide covers essential cybersecurity measures every small business should implement in 2026.</p>
        
        <div class="prose prose-invert prose-lg max-w-none">

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">1. Strong Password Policies: Your First Line of Defense</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Weak passwords remain one of the most common security vulnerabilities. Implement these password best practices across your organization:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="text-white">Minimum 12 characters:</strong> Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack. Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Unique passwords for each account:</strong> Never reuse passwords across multiple services. If one gets compromised, all accounts remain safe.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Password managers:</strong> Tools like 1Password, Bitwarden, or LastPass generate and securely store complex passwords, eliminating the need to remember them all.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Regular password changes:</strong> Update critical passwords quarterly, especially for admin and financial accounts.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Avoid common patterns:</strong> Never use "Password123" or personal information like birthdays, names, or company names.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Add an Extra Layer</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Two-factor authentication requires a second verification step beyond your password—typically a code sent to your phone or generated by an authenticator app. Even if hackers steal your password, they can't access your account without the second factor.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Enable 2FA on ALL critical accounts: email, banking, payment processors, cloud storage, social media, and administrative systems. Prefer authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy) over SMS codes, which can be intercepted through SIM swapping attacks.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">3. Regular Software Updates: Patch Vulnerabilities</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Cybercriminals exploit known software vulnerabilities. Manufacturers release patches and updates to fix these security holes. Delaying updates leaves your systems exposed.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, and applications</li>
                <li>Update firmware on routers, firewalls, and network devices regularly</li>
                <li>Replace unsupported software that no longer receives security patches</li>
                <li>Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production systems</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">4. Comprehensive Backup Strategy: Prepare for the Worst</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Ransomware attacks encrypt your data and demand payment for decryption keys. The best defense? Regular, tested backups that let you restore operations without paying criminals.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="text-white">3 copies of your data:</strong> The original plus two backups</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">2 different storage media:</strong> External drives, cloud storage, network-attached storage (NAS)</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">1 offsite copy:</strong> Protect against physical disasters like fire, flood, or theft</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Automate daily backups and test restoration monthly. Verify that backups are complete, uncorrupted, and can actually restore your critical systems.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">5. Employee Training: Your Human Firewall</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">90% of successful cyberattacks involve human error—clicking phishing links, downloading malware, or falling for social engineering. Your employees are either your greatest vulnerability or your strongest defense.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Conduct quarterly security awareness training covering:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Recognizing phishing emails: suspicious links, urgent language, unexpected attachments</li>
                <li>Safe browsing habits: avoiding untrusted websites and downloads</li>
                <li>Physical security: locking computers when away, not sharing passwords</li>
                <li>Reporting procedures: how to report suspicious activity immediately</li>
                <li>Social engineering tactics: phone scams impersonating IT support or executives</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">6. Secure Wi-Fi Networks: Lock Down Wireless Access</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Unsecured Wi-Fi networks broadcast your business data to anyone within range. Configure your network securely:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Use WPA3 encryption (or WPA2 if WPA3 isn't available)</li>
                <li>Change default router admin passwords immediately</li>
                <li>Hide your network SSID (name) from public broadcast</li>
                <li>Create a separate guest network for visitors—isolated from business systems</li>
                <li>Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), which has known vulnerabilities</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">7. Firewall and Antivirus Protection: Essential Barriers</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Firewalls control network traffic, blocking unauthorized access. Antivirus software detects and removes malware. Together, they form your baseline defense:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Enable firewalls on all devices—computers, servers, network routers</li>
                <li>Install reputable antivirus/anti-malware software on every endpoint</li>
                <li>Keep security software updated with latest threat definitions</li>
                <li>Schedule regular full system scans</li>
                <li>Consider enterprise-grade solutions like endpoint detection and response (EDR)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">8. Access Control: Limit Who Sees What</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Not everyone needs access to everything. Apply the principle of least privilege: grant employees only the access necessary for their specific roles.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Create role-based permissions for files, folders, and applications</li>
                <li>Restrict administrative privileges to essential personnel only</li>
                <li>Implement identity and access management (IAM) systems</li>
                <li>Revoke access immediately when employees leave or change roles</li>
                <li>Audit access logs regularly for unusual activity</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">9. Secure Payment Processing: Protect Customer Data</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you accept credit cards, you must comply with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). Even if compliance isn't legally required, these practices protect your customers:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Use reputable payment processors (Stripe, Square, PayPal) that handle card data</li>
                <li>Never store full credit card numbers, CVV codes, or magnetic stripe data</li>
                <li>Encrypt payment data in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest</li>
                <li>Segment your payment systems from other networks</li>
                <li>Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">10. Incident Response Plan: Prepare for Breaches</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Despite best efforts, breaches can still occur. An incident response plan minimizes damage and speeds recovery:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Document step-by-step procedures for different breach scenarios</li>
                <li>Assign specific roles and responsibilities to team members</li>
                <li>Establish communication protocols for customers, partners, and authorities</li>
                <li>Keep contact information for cybersecurity experts, legal counsel, and law enforcement</li>
                <li>Practice incident response drills annually</li>
                <li>Document lessons learned after incidents to improve defenses</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">Conclusion: Cybersecurity is an Ongoing Investment</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Cybersecurity isn't a one-time project—it's an ongoing commitment. Threats evolve constantly, and your defenses must evolve with them. Start with these fundamentals, then build more sophisticated protections as your business grows.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">The cost of prevention is always less than the cost of recovery. A data breach can result in regulatory fines, legal fees, lost revenue, and irreparable reputational damage. Invest in cybersecurity today to protect your business tomorrow.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Remember: you don't need a massive budget or dedicated IT team to implement basic security. Many protections are free or low-cost. What you need is commitment, consistency, and awareness across your entire organization.</p>
