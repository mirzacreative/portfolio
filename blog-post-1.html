        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="text-xl text-slate-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Graphic design is more than just making things look pretty — it's about effective visual communication that captures attention, conveys messages, and creates lasting impressions. Whether you're a beginner designer or looking to refresh your fundamentals, understanding these core principles will elevate your design work to professional standards.</p>
        
        <div class="prose prose-invert prose-lg max-w-none">
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">1. Balance: Creating Visual Stability</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Balance in design refers to the distribution of visual weight across your composition. Just like a scale, your design elements need to be arranged in a way that feels stable and harmonious. There are three types of balance:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="text-white">Symmetrical Balance:</strong> Elements are mirrored on both sides of a central axis, creating formal and stable designs perfect for corporate branding and traditional layouts.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Asymmetrical Balance:</strong> Different elements with equal visual weight are distributed unevenly, creating dynamic and modern compositions that feel more energetic and contemporary.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Radial Balance:</strong> Elements radiate from a central point, commonly used in logos, mandalas, and circular designs that draw the eye to the center.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">When working on your next design project, consciously assess whether your layout feels balanced. If one side feels "heavier," adjust sizing, color intensity, or positioning to achieve equilibrium.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">2. Contrast: Making Elements Stand Out</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Contrast is what makes your design pop and guides the viewer's eye to the most important elements. It can be achieved through differences in color, size, shape, texture, or typography. High contrast creates drama and emphasis, while low contrast feels subtle and sophisticated.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">In 2026, designers are leveraging contrast not just for aesthetics but for accessibility. Ensuring sufficient color contrast ratios (at least 4.5:1 for normal text) makes your designs readable for everyone, including those with visual impairments. Tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker help verify your color choices meet WCAG standards.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Pro tip: Use contrast strategically on call-to-action buttons, headlines, and key information. If everything contrasts equally, nothing stands out — hierarchy gets lost in visual noise.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">3. Typography: The Art of Type Selection</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Typography is one of the most powerful tools in a designer's arsenal. The fonts you choose communicate personality, set the tone, and impact readability. In 2026, variable fonts are becoming standard, offering multiple weights and styles in a single file for better performance and flexibility.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Key typography principles include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="text-white">Font Pairing:</strong> Combine 2-3 fonts maximum — typically a serif or sans-serif for headings and a complementary font for body text.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Hierarchy:</strong> Use size, weight, and spacing to create clear levels of importance (H1, H2, body, captions).</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Readability:</strong> Maintain appropriate line height (1.5-1.75 for body text), comfortable line length (50-75 characters), and sufficient letter spacing.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Alignment:</strong> Left-aligned text is easiest to read for Western audiences; center alignment works for short headlines but fatigues readers in long passages.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">4. Color Theory: Psychology and Application</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Color is emotional. It influences mood, perception, and behavior. Understanding color theory helps you make intentional choices that support your message. The color wheel reveals relationships:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="text-white">Complementary:</strong> Colors opposite on the wheel (blue/orange, red/green) create vibrant, high-energy contrasts.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Analogous:</strong> Colors next to each other (blue, blue-green, green) create harmonious, cohesive palettes.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Triadic:</strong> Three colors equally spaced (red, yellow, blue) offer balanced diversity.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Monochromatic:</strong> Variations of a single hue create sophisticated, unified designs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Cultural context matters — red means luck in China but danger in Western cultures. Always research your target audience's color associations before finalizing your palette.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">5. Whitespace: The Power of Nothing</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Also called negative space, whitespace is the empty area between and around design elements. Far from being wasted space, it's a strategic tool that improves comprehension, creates breathing room, and emphasizes important content.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Generous whitespace signals quality and sophistication — think Apple's minimalist product pages. Cramped layouts feel cluttered and amateur. In 2026, with attention spans shrinking, whitespace helps viewers process information efficiently by reducing cognitive load.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">6. Alignment: Creating Order and Connection</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Nothing should be placed arbitrarily on your canvas. Every element should have a visual connection to something else through alignment. This creates invisible lines that guide the eye and establish relationships between elements.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Use grids and guides to maintain consistent alignment. Modern design tools like Figma and Adobe XD offer smart guides that snap elements into perfect alignment. Even a few pixels of misalignment can make designs feel sloppy and unprofessional.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">7. Repetition: Building Visual Consistency</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Repeating visual elements — colors, fonts, shapes, spacing — creates unity and strengthens brand recognition. Consistent button styles, heading treatments, and iconography make interfaces intuitive and designs memorable.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Design systems and style guides document these repetitive patterns, ensuring consistency across multiple designers and platforms. In 2026, component-based design workflows make repetition efficient through reusable design tokens and components.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">8. Proximity: Grouping Related Elements</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Elements that are related should be grouped closely together, while unrelated elements should have more space between them. This principle helps viewers understand relationships and organization at a glance.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">For example, on a business card, your name, title, and contact information should be grouped distinctly. In web design, navigation items should be close together but separated from body content.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">9. Visual Hierarchy: Guiding the Eye</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Hierarchy determines the order in which viewers process information. Size, color, contrast, and positioning all contribute to establishing importance. The most critical element should dominate, followed by secondary and tertiary information.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Eye-tracking studies show viewers follow F-patterns and Z-patterns when scanning content. Position your most important message where eyes naturally land first — typically the top left for Western audiences.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">10. Consistency: Your Secret Weapon</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Finally, consistency ties everything together. Once you establish your design rules (color palette, typography scale, spacing system), apply them consistently throughout your project. This creates a polished, professional appearance that builds trust and credibility.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Document your decisions in a style guide. Future you (and your team) will thank you when making updates or expanding the design system.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-white">Conclusion: Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Mastering these 10 graphic design principles doesn't happen overnight. They require practice, experimentation, and critique. Study designs you admire and identify which principles they leverage effectively. Analyze designs that don't work and pinpoint which principles are violated.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">In 2026, as AI design tools become more sophisticated, these fundamental principles remain your competitive advantage. Tools can generate layouts, but human designers who understand why certain design decisions work will always create more meaningful, effective communications.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6">Start applying these principles to your next project today. Begin with one or two, master them, then gradually incorporate more until they become second nature. Your design work will transform from good to exceptional.</p>
